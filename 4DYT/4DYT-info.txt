The concordance is based on the following CQP query applied to a version of the tagged LOB corpus transformed into a vrt format (see below):

[word="(beg[ia]n[sning]*|start[edsing]*)"%c & pos="V.*"] ([word="to"%c] [pos="(VB|HV|DO|BE)"]|[pos="(VB|HV|DO|BE)G"]);


Transforming the LOB corpus into vrt format:

The LOB corpus is available for download at http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12024/0167. One of the formats provided is found in the directory LOB_PLAIN_TAGGED in a single file. The text looks like this:

 '_' stop_VB electing_VBG life_NN peers_NNS '_' ._.
 by_IN Trevor_NP Williams_NP ._.

This can easily be transformed into a vertical format (vrt) using a regular expression like the following:

Search: \s*\b(\S+)_(\S+)\s*
Replace: \1\t\2\n
